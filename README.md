## Structure  

### **Trab1_Stack**  
**Project:** Navigation System Simulation Using Stack 
**Objective:** Implement a stack-based system to simulate web browser navigation with features like moving forward and backward between pages.  
**Features:**  
- Add new URLs (`novo`).  
- Go back to the previous page (`anterior`).  
- Move forward to the next page (`posterior`).  
- Exit the program (`sair`).

### **Trab2_Trees**  
**Project:** Binary Tree Implementation  
**Objective:** Develop and manipulate a binary tree for storing and retrieving elements.  
**Features:**  
- Insert nodes into the tree.  
- Traverse the tree using pre-order, in-order, and post-order methods.  
- Search for specific elements in the tree.
